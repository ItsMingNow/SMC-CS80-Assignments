<!-- Assignment 7.11 -->
<!-- Drivers are concerned with the mileage obtained by their automobiles.
One driver has kept track of several tankfuls of gasoline (you need to prompt
for the number of tankfuls) by recording the number of miles driven and the
number of gallons used for each tankful. Develop a script that will take as
input the miles driven and gallons used (both as integers) for each tankful.
The script should calculate and output HTML5 text that displays the number of
miles per gallon obtained for each tankful and prints the combined number of
miles per gallons obtained for all tankfuls up to this point. Use prompt dialogs
to obtain the data from the user. -->
